## Integrative structure determination of the yeast NPC

### Summary

Nuclear pore complexes (NPCs) mediate the nucleocytoplasmic transport of macromolecules. Here we provide a structure of the isolated yeast NPC in which the inner ring is resolved by cryo-EM at sub-nanometer resolution to show how flexible connectors tie together different structural and functional layers. However, at the current resolution, orphan densities were revealed in the spoke that could not be accounted for by docked models. The density of these orphans is similar to neighboring Nups which indicates a high occupancy. We identified three orphans (group of 3) that interact with 3-helix bundles in the diagonal walls, and a gap at the center of the spoke is filled by 4 orphans arranged in two groups of 2. We also identified 3 orphan helices that bind to Nup192 and two orphan helices that bind to Nup188, which are present in two copies per spoke. In total, 30 orphan densities were mapped in the spoke that arise from flexible connectors. To solve the identity and connectivity of these orphans, we applied an integrative threading approach (Saltzberg et al., 2019) to compute Nup identity, copy identifier, and sequence segments for structure elements (SEs) in each orphan. This resulted in 28 orphan SEs being confidently assigned to contiguous sequences in four Nic96 N-terminal domains (NTDs).

Additionally, we used integrative modeling to determine the structure of the lumenal Pom152 ring in its restricted and dilated form.
